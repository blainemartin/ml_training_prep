An all-in one toolset for downloading and preparing training data before using it to train a Lora for the MythoMax 13b LLM.

Use the ML Data Prep notebook to download, parse, and format a variety of Star Trek data sets from across the web and export it to Google Drive in txt format for Lora training.

Use the MythoMax Lora Trainer notebook to test the MythoMax LLM running my premade LoRA, or to train your own (stored in Google Drive).

All other scripts are designed to support the notebooks but can be used on their own when/if needed.
